# Hey, I'm IronManCoderX! 👨‍💻

I write code like I’m Iron Man — occasionally saving the day, but mostly fixing bugs. 😅

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python (forever trusty), JavaScript (always an adventure), TypeScript (because why not?)
- **Frameworks**: React (cooler than Iron Man’s suit), Node.js (it just works), Flask (light and fast)
- **Databases**: MongoDB (who needs tables?), PostgreSQL (I try to be professional sometimes)
- **Tools**: Git (my BFF), Docker (shipping code like a pro), AWS (cloud for everything)
  
## 💡 Fun Facts:
- I spend more time debugging than writing code. 🔍
- My code runs perfectly... until I push it to production. 😬
- I explain recursion to my dog. He’s still not impressed. 🐶
  
Tech updates faster than my bugs get fixed. 😜
